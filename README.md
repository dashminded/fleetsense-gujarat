## Problem Statement

Gujarat's private bus operators (Patel Travels, Swaminarayan Travels, etc.) deploy
buses based on intuition — no data system exists for route-level planning.
This causes two losses simultaneously:

- **Weekdays:** Buses run 50–60% empty → wasted fuel, driver cost, toll cost
- **Festivals (Navratri, Diwali, Uttarayan):** Buses 100% full, passengers
  turned away → lost revenue, poor customer experience

No affordable demand forecasting tool exists for small/mid-size Gujarat
private operators. This project builds one.

---

## What This Project Does

Given a **route** and a **date**, FleetSense tells the operator:
- How full the bus is expected to be (forecasted occupancy %)
- How many buses to deploy (Add 2 / Add 1 / Keep / Remove 1)
- Estimated revenue gain or cost saved from that decision (₹)

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tool |
|-------|------|
| Data Generation | Python — Pandas, NumPy |
| Database | MySQL 8.0 (4 tables, 12 business queries) |
| EDA + Forecasting | Jupyter Notebook — Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Prophet |
| Dashboard | Power BI Desktop (7 visuals) |
| Web App | Streamlit — deployed on Community Cloud |

---

## Dataset

> **Synthetic data** simulated from real-world research — ticket prices from
> AbhiBus/RedBus listings, actual Gujarat festival dates (2023–2024), real
> fuel economics (diesel ₹95/L, Non-AC = 4.5 kmpl, AC = 2.65 kmpl).
> The same pipeline works on real operator data with zero code changes.

| File | Rows | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `routes.csv` | 12 | 12 Gujarat intercity routes with distance, tier, base price |
| `bus_inventory.csv` | 59 | 59 buses — 4 types (Non-AC/AC Seater/Sleeper) |
| `festivals.csv` | 33 | Real Gujarat festivals 2023–2024 with demand multipliers |
| `daily_bookings.csv` | 43,129 | Main fact table — every bus, every route, every day |

**Routes covered:**
AMD→Surat · AMD→Rajkot · AMD→Vadodara · AMD→Bhuj · AMD→Jamnagar ·
AMD→Junagadh · AMD→Dwarka · AMD→Somnath · AMD→Porbandar · AMD→Gandhidham ·
Rajkot→Surat · Surat→Vadodara

**Simulated business scale:** ₹72 Cr revenue · ₹41 Cr cost · ₹30 Cr profit (2 years)

## Prophet Forecast Accuracy

Trained on Jan 2023 – Sep 2024 | Tested on Oct – Dec 2024 (held-out quarter)

| Route | MAE | RMSE |
|-------|-----|------|
| AMD→Gandhidham | 12.99% | 15.67% |
| AMD→Bhuj | 11.23% | 15.19% |
| AMD→Dwarka | 6.47% | 9.72% |
| AMD→Jamnagar | 6.24% | 9.50% |
| AMD→Porbandar | 6.46% | 9.27% |
| Rajkot→Surat | 6.24% | 9.15% |
| AMD→Somnath | 5.88% | 9.06% |
| AMD→Junagadh | 5.99% | 8.96% |
| AMD→Surat | 4.84% | 8.89% |
| Surat→Vadodara | 5.74% | 8.84% |
| AMD→Rajkot | 4.66% | 8.47% |
| AMD→Vadodara | 4.88% | 8.47% |

> MAE and RMSE reported on occupancy rate (0.0–1.0 scale).
> e.g. RMSE = 0.06 means forecast is off by ~6 percentage points on average.

##  SQL Layer

**Database:** `fleetsense_gujarat` | **Tables:** `routes`, `bus_inventory`, `festivals`, `daily_bookings`

12 business queries covering:

| # | Query | SQL Concept Used |
|---|-------|-----------------|
| Q3 | Festival vs normal day revenue | `CASE WHEN` |
| Q5 | Monthly revenue trend 2023 vs 2024 | `GROUP BY year, month` |
| Q7 | Loss-making trips % per route | Conditional aggregation |
| Q9 | Fuel cost as % of revenue | Calculated ratio |
| Q11 | Fleet recommendation frequency | `GROUP BY` + percentage |
| Q12 | Day-of-week demand rank per route | `RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY)` |

## Key Business Insights

- **Navratri + Diwali** push occupancy 30%+ above the normal day average —
  adding 2 buses on major routes during these periods generates ~₹8,000–14,000
  net profit per route per day
- **Monday/Tuesday** are lowest demand days across all routes — removing 1 bus
  saves ~₹4,200/day in fuel + driver cost on Tier2/Tier3 routes
- **Rann Utsav (Nov–Feb)** creates sustained 50% demand increase on AMD→Bhuj
  and AMD→Gandhidham specifically — a pattern only visible with regional data
- **AMD→Surat** needs an extra bus 34% of all operating days — highest
  deployment pressure of any route in the network
